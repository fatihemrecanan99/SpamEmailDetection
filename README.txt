# Spam Classifier

The Multinomial Naive Bayes and Bernoulli Naive Bayes methods are used by this spam classifier software to determine whether an email is spam or not.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pandas
- numpy

## How to run the program

1. Make sure you have installed the required packages (pandas, numpy) by running:

2. Go to the directory where the "q3.py" file is located to run the application.. It will automatically run all the questions answers that needed Python code. 

By default, the program will use the provided 'X_train.csv', 'X_test.csv', 'y_train.csv', and 'y_test.csv' files for training and testing.

## Reading the outputs

The program will output the following information for each algorithm:
-------------------------------------
Question 2.1.1
 -Percentage of spam emails
 -Percentage of non-spam emails
-------------------------------------
Question 2.2-2.3-2.4
 - Accuracy
 - Confusion Matrix
 - Precision
 - Recall
 - F1 Score
----------------------------------------
As the software executes, the outcomes will be shown in the terminal. By comparing the result measures, you can assess how well the Multinomial Naive Bayes and Bernoulli Naive Bayes algorithms performed and it also mentioned in report corresponding question answer.
## Customizing the program

If you want to alter the input file paths or other options, you can edit the preset parameters in the "q3.py" file. Before starting the application, make sure the appropriate file paths and settings have been updated.
